    <pre><p>Based in upstate, NY, I believe web development and generative AI have the power 
        to shift society when use responsibly and is inclusive of diverse perspectives. I’m 
        currently transitioning from a career as an artist, which gives me a unique take on 
        the world. Art is primarily about problem-solving through unconventional tactics. 
        Through my work as a Public Artist and Sculptor, I’ve gained valuable experience as 
        both a leader and a team player working within the public realm. It relates directly 
        to the user experience within web development because I’m trying to figure out how to 
        solicit interaction. It’s a primary focus of mine to create work that gets busy people 
        to stop and spend as much time as possible with my piece.</p></pre>
