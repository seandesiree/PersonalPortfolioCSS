        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <h2>HubListen Chatbot</h2>
        <pre><p>To gain more experience with AI I participated in a hackathon. The Baddies In Tech Womenâ€™s 
          Rights Hackathon allowed me to work with a team of five to develop a chatbot that supports women, 
          trans, and nonbinary people in navigating issues relating to reproductive justice, employment, 
          and gender-based violence. I knew that if I wanted a career in tech I would need to understand 
          how to work collaboratively with a diverse team and with short deadlines. We created the concept 
          together and my role was Back End and AI Engineer. My responsibilities consisted of building the 
          backend infrastructure using Python and integrating it with OpenAI technology. I programmed the 
          chatbot to allow the user to set the personality of the bot and have it remember the chat history.</p></pre>

        <h2>Out in Tech Digital Corps</h2>
        <pre><p>I worked with a team of nine people, including developers, designers, and copywriters to 
          help build a WordPress website for an LGBTQ organization in Nigeria. I met with the client before 
          developing the site to ask questions and implement their key needs. I successfully built the 
          leadership page of the website.</p></pre>
